## 💡What's the Flutter Matrix?

<p style="text-indent: 2em">
The matrix class designed for Flutter can also be used in pure Dart, 
and is also a full-platform alternative to the Matply library. 
It supports basic matrix operations, linear algebra, probability
theory and mathematical statistics, geometric simulation, central difference, etc.

## 📄Need a local document?
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
Flutter Matrix provides a local docs (by markdown) folder and a building module based on mkdocs. If you have Python on your environment, switch to the same directory as the mkdocs.yml file and run the following command.
</p>

```text
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material pymdown-extensions mkdocs-material-extensions
```
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
After successfully installing the above libraries, run the following command again. You will find that you have generated a folder named site. Open the index.html in the folder to browse the online web documents.

</p>

```
mkdocs build
```

## 🛎️Attention.
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
I will continue to improve the documentation later, and some of them will be demonstrated using Flutter charts.
