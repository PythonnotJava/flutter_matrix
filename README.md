## ðŸ’¡What's the Flutter Matrix?

```
The matrix class designed for Flutter can also be used in pure Dart, 
and is also a full-platform alternative to the Matply library. 
It supports basic matrix operations, linear algebra, probability
theory and mathematical statistics, geometric simulation, central difference, etc.
